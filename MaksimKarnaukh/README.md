# Exploratory Data Analysis Exercise

## Overview
This is a repository for the Exploratory Data Analysis Exercise. The goal of this exercise is to explore, verify and understand the data. The data is from the H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations competition on Kaggle. The data can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data?select=articles.csv.
## Dependencies
The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install the dependencies run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
The notebook is self-contained and can be run as is. The data is expected to be in the same directory as the notebook. The notebook is expected to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Note: The EDA.ipynb file uses a lot of functions from the EDA.py file. The EDA.py file is not meant to be run as a standalone file. It is meant to be imported into the EDA.ipynb file.
