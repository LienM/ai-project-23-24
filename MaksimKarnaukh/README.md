# AI project: research

## Project description

In this project, we make use of the 
[H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data) 
to build a recommender system. For more information, please click on the link.

Dataset description:

For this challenge you are given the purchase history of customers across time, 
along with supporting metadata. Your challenge is to predict what articles each 
customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately after the training data ends. 
Customer who did not make any purchase during that time are excluded from the scoring.

## Project goal

It was the intention that we come up with one or more research questions and try to answer them.

### Research questions

1) "How effective are graph-based recommendation algorithms in capturing customer-item interactions, and can they enhance recommendations in a cold-start scenario? (Can we change popularity impact?)"


2) "How effective is the use of a combination of features for generating personalized candidates and ranking them compared to a pure popularity-based approach?"


## Project structure

The most important parts of the project are:

* `04-Research/` - folder with files related to my first research question.
* `05-Research/` - folder with files related to my second research question.

Each folder has a respective README.md file with more information.
