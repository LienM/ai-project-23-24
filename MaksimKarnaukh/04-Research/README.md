# Feature Engineering Exercise

## Overview
This is a repository for the first research question:

"How effective are graph-based recommendation algorithms in capturing customer-item interactions, and can they enhance recommendations in a cold-start scenario? (Can we change popularity impact?)"

This research question, although I tried very hard, I could not answer because I couldn't get the code to run properly.
Everything in this folder (04-Research) is related to this first research question and **should not be looked at**.
