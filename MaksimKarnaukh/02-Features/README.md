# Feature Engineering Exercise

## Overview
This is a repository for the Feature Engineering Exercise. The goal of this exercise is to choose 2-3 features and implement them, with the help of “Radek's LGBMRanker starter-pack” (see section 'sources used' for link).
## Dependencies
The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install the dependencies run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
