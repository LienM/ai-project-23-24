## Course overview and learning outcomes

The main objective of this course is to learn how to design, analyze, and solve a complex data science problem in practice. During this course, youâ€™ll gain experience in the thorough analysis of a large practical data science problem and in the development and presentation of a practical solution. Weâ€™ll provide you with short lectures, materials for further learning and a few ideas to get you started on your own submission to a data science competition!Â ðŸš€
