## Structure

This folder contains the following:

**00 - Dataset** : Example data used (will not be included)
 
**01 - Tensorflow**  :  This folder contains an attempt to implement a two-tower model using TensorFlow. Due to difficulties in running the model successfully with HM data, this approach was ultimately abandoned.
- The exact details of the implementation can be found in the README file within this folder.
    
**02 - Recpack** : This folder contains the implementation of the models using Recpack. This approach was deemed successful and provides comprehensive resources.
    
- The exact details of the implementation can be found in the README file within this folder.
