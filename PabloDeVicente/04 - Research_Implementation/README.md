## Structure

This folder contains the following:

    dataset/ : Example data used (will not be included obviously)

    Reckpack.ipynb : Functioning implementation of RecPack library with hm data

    Tensorflow2 : Functioning implementation of Tensorflow Two tower model with sample data
    Tensorflow5 : Incorrect implementation of Tensorflow Two tower model with hm data

    functions.py : Scrip with basic functions 
    
## Overview

    Tensorflow two tower model has not been implemented correctly with hm data, due to different problems (installation, resources...)
    Recpack contains a basic model, trained with a fraction of the transactions dataset.

## Follow up

    Unify dataset in order to contain user data (id, age and postal code) + item data (id, colour and group_id) + transaction timestamp
    Evaluate how to improve performance on local computer or continue with cloud installation (using google colab or similar)
