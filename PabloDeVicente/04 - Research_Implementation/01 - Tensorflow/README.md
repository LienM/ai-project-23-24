This folder contains the implementation of a two-tower model using TensorFlow. 

## Files
- Tensorflow1: This file represents the initial implementation based on a provided guide, but it failed to function properly.
- Tensorflow2: This file follows a different guide and successfully works with sample data.
- Tensorflow4: This implementation handles Human Movement (HM) data but encountered a type mismatch error, preventing further progress.
- Tensorflow5 and 6: These files represent unsuccessful attempts to load a custom dataset using different methods, all leading to incomplete or faulty implementations.
- functions.py :  Aux notebook containing 

In summary, the notebooks within this folder do not provide relevant information for the Recpack implementation, which is handled in the designated folder.
