# AI Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the AI Project course assignment.
**Note** : Folders preceded by '00 -' are auxiliary and not essential for understanding the project.
## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

0. Clone the repository.
1. Download dataset from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data?select=articles.csv]
2. Create a folder inside data for each of the csv files. The folder has to be named in the same way as the .csv (more information in 00 - Dataset folder)

## Assignment 1 - EDA

The first assignment focuses on examining the dataset, making basic observations, and performing initial analysis. This provides a foundation for understanding the data and identifying potential areas for further exploration.

## Assignment 2 - Feature Engineering

This assignment involves refactoring and enhancing Radek's LightGBM ranker model by introducing additional features. This step aims to improve the model's performance by extracting meaningful information from the dataset.

- Preprocessing: Before running the 02 - Feature_Engineering notebook, it's necessary to preprocess the data using the 00 - LGBMRanker/01_Solution_warmup notebook. This preprocesses the dataset and prepares it for feature engineering.

## Assignment 3 - Reseach Questions

The third assignment involves formulating a plan for the research questions that will be investigated throughout the project. This involves identifying specific topics or areas of interest and defining clear research questions to guide the investigation.

## Assignment 4 - Research Implementation

This is the most substantial portion of the repository, containing the implementation of the research work and intermediate files generated during trial and error. This folder provides a detailed view of the research process, including experimentation and refinement of the models.

## Assignment 5 - Documentation

The final assignment focuses on documenting the project findings and presenting the key takeaways from the research. This includes creating final presentation slides and generating a comprehensive report that summarizes the research journey and its outcomes. Would be advised to read it before looking at the raw files.
