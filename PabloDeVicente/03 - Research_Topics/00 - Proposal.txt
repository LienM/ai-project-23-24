1 - FEATURE ENGINEERING :

	QUESTION : How can the use of weighting techniques enhance the performance of content-based recommender systems?
	
	RESEARCH IDEAS : 
		TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with the following algorithims
			Collaborative Filtering : 
				User-Based Collaborative Filtering : Recommends items based on the preferences of users with similar behavior.
				Item-Based Collaborative Filtering : Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in.
			Content-based:
				Matrix Factorization : identify latent factors that represent clothing preferences and make recommendations accordingly.
				Association Rule Mining : Discover patterns in clothing purchases, such as "People who bought X also bought Y" and make recommendations based on these associations.

		Information retrieval course has a ton of literature (papers and books) to investigate
		I could allways ask the professor for advice
		
	METHODOLOGY :
		1. Get a decent theoretical knowledge base
		2. "Play around" with some sample data to understand the algorithms used
		3. Implement it into hm data
		4. See results
		5. If not successfull, go back to first point
	
	EVALUATION : 
		I do not know at the moment what kinds of evaluation tools there are. It would be nice to find a script that scores the algorithm used 
		I will not use kaggle inside metric (at first) as we've seen it is 'contest - focused'		


2 - ALGORITHMS :
	
	QUESTION : Study the benefits of implementing a hybrid collaborative algorithmns, such as Two tower model
	
	RESEARCH IDEAS :
		Compare the two tower model to other collaborative filtering methods
		Explore how the two tower model can be applied in recommendation systems
		Investigate techniques for optimizing the Two Tower model's performance
		Investigate techniques on how to evaluate collaborative models
		
	RELATED LITERATURE : 
		two towe model in recommender system : https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/6096
											 : https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01737
											 : https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366424.3386195
	METHODOLOGY :
		get a baseline result for the collaborative filter techniques (individually)
		implement two tower algorithims in sample data (testing)
		implement two tower algorithims in hm data
		compare results with baseline
			
	EVALUATION :
		MAP : Measure the precision of the recommendations for various users and calculate the average.
		Coverage: Evaluate how well the Two Tower model can cover the entire item catalog or user base. Higher coverage can be a benefit.
		Diversity: Assess the diversity of recommendations. A good recommendation system should not recommend the same items repeatedly but offer diverse options.
		Novelty: Measure how well the Two Tower model can recommend new or less popular items, not just the most popular ones.
			I will be focusing on this one primarily
		Efficiency: Evaluate the computational efficiency of the model, including training and prediction times
		

3 - ALGORITHMS (extra) :

	QUESTION :  Mixed negative sampling for learning two tower model networks
