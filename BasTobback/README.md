# AI-Project repository BAS TOBBACK
This repository holds all files and intermediate solutions and/or steps for the recommendation problem given in this ccourse.
Each folder represents the files and information needed for each section of the project.
The folder with the Final submission is the most relevant one as it holds my final solution. But the other files accompanied with their own (slightly smaller) README's provided useful insight in the process.

Note that almost all files were developed on kaggle and thus are best run on kaggle to ensure the ability to run this project.

This project provides an attempt to improve candidate generation and kaggle score through recommending the most popular items to the user based on their age groups rather than the entire user dataset.
This in unison with the ensuring that this happens for users absent for other methods and the added features indicating which of these methods created the candidates it provides a better score on Kaggle, stemming from better recall scores on the candidates.

Useful roadmap for directories:
* EDA: exploratory data analysis from the first assignment
* Baseline: 
* Feature engineering: assignment 2
* RQ1: all research regarding the age groups incorporated in candidate generation and predictions
* Final Submission: the last submission and changes, contains the final file with the best score I was able to conjure
