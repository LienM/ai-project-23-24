# Exploratory analysis
This party of the project contains 3 files.

The first: 'EDA.py' was a tryout that was not further used.
It has been cleared of code because the code only gave errors, so this was not really safe to put on github.

The second file 'EDA.ipynb' is the first part of the EDA I performed, this was done on my drive in google colab. I quickly switched to my home PC
due to connectivity issues with colab. So the rest was done on my PC in the file 'EDA_onPC.ipynb'.

Th Parts are divided in the file itself. Each csv has been analyzed which is indicates by a title inside the jupyter notbook
