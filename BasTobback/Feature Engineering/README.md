# Feature engineering 
For feature engineering steps I firstly changed all the age values that were actually NAN at first to the median, right now the values were still -1.

other steps were taken immediately after and can be foun in the 'MY CODE' section in the file. There are two of those sections and are both ended with a 'end of my code' to indicate that the remainder of the code is from the baseline.
