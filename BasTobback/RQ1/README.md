# RESEARCH 
All files are notebook files and are used on kaggle, where the baseline is located. I mainly edited the baseline on Kaggle so this code may not run on your machines. This could however be run on kaggle.
## First question
The first research question was about improving recall of the candidate generation process by grouping according to age groups
For this I used the baseline of RADEK.  In addition to the adding of some of my features, and other things, I also sometimes added some comments or markdowns for better readability. This my mostly for my own sake.

For this first question I made the 'researchquestion1_v1' file. In this I made several sections where changes are made. This is a list of all these section trying to describe the exact changes and the places, so you will not have to look for them.
1. **TEST WEEK**: This section goes from the title 'test week' until the title 'generating candidates'. Here I change the test week into a more easily changed variable to test out different weeks. On top of that the transactions are changed so that the last 10 weeks before that week are used.
2. **RECALL**: this part starts from the title ' Making a recall evaluation function' and end at 'making ne group of candidates based on age group'. In this part I personally made a recall evaluation function. I did this by looping over all users and calculating their recall by taking subsets of these tables and performing some selection operations to then calculate some values. Doing this made the function so immensely slow that I asked Noah Daniels for help. He helped me come to a solution based on merges. This function ultimately returns the mean recall value.
3. **AGE GROUPS**: Starts at 'Making a new group of candidates based on age group' and stops at 'My Code'. Here several things are done:
   * The age groups are created, and then applied on the dataset. 
   * Then the bestseller candidates are generated by altering the process for bestsellers from RADEK with grouping on age groups as addition.
   * Checking the recall happens in the section 'check the recall'

In the end the age group bestseller rank was not yet used, neither was age group itself. This was because the focus was on candidate generation and  not score improvement.
