# AI Project

This is the code provided for each of the assignments in the course AI Project.
Any folder preceded by '00 -' is auxiliary and not worth to look at.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

0. Clone the repository.
1. Download dataset from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data?select=articles.csv]
2. Create a folder inside data for each of the csv files. The folder has to be named in the same way as the .csv

## Assignment 1 - EDA

Introduction to the dataset, basic observations and anaylis.

## Assignment 2 - Feature Engineering

The starting point for this assignment is Radek's LGBM ranker. Refactorization and introduction of basic features. In order to run the 02 - Feature_Engineering notebook we first have to preprocess some data. For this we use 00 - LGBMRanker/01_Solution_warmup first.

## Assignment 3 - Reseach Questions

The aim of this assignment is to make a plan of the questions that will later be researched.
