## Assignment Description

The goal of this assignment was to get a better understanding of the data we were working with.
Here, I went over every dataset, and tried to spot some interesting patterns using both tables and graphs, as
I thought that would be the simplest approach.

There isn't a particular plan behind the order I made my investigations, I mostly
did what I thought would be interesting at the time.

General observations were noted down below each dataset and graph, but the most important ones are:
- Different age-groups in dataset
- Preference to offline sales
- Real-world price can be recovered
- Discounts can be recovered
- Some clothing categories are significantly more popular
- Most products are under 50€
